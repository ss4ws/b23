# Open By Design 

This is an Open Educational Resource (OER) project dedicated to making a French university-level course, Business in French, open source and accessible. 
Our mission is to openly publish this course so that any educator, student, or individual can utilize the materials however they wish. 
This course is a global simulation where students study successful francophone start-ups and get inspiration to create their own mock-up start-up company at the end of the semester.  

This project was built using Quarto, an open publishing system that utilizes Markdown, a markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.
